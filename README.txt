Surly is an implementation of SURLY, a database management system. Numerous
commands from SURLY are implemented, while others are not.

How to run:
To compile Surly, run the following command:

	javac Main.java

To run Surly, run the following command:

	java Main <Input file name> 

The input file contains commands that Surly reads and executes. The input file
must reside in the same directory as Main.java. The image file, surlyimage.txt,
must also reside the same directory in order for the image to be displayed.
